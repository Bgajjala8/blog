Hi, Iâ€™m Bharath Gajjala. Iâ€™m a software engineer focused on distributed systems and building scalable, reliable solutions at the enterprise level. I enjoy solving complex problems that directly affect our quality of life as humans.

Based in the SF Bay Area, I write about engineering, system design, and the lessons Iâ€™ve learned along the way. Iâ€™d love to meet for coffee, exchange ideas, and make new friendsâ€”feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
