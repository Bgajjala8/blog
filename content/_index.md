Welcome to my digital corner! I'm Bharath, an enthusiastic software engineer with a primary focus on exploring the intricacies of distributed computing and delving deep into the world of low-level operating systems.

With nearly 3 years of hands-on experience, I've played a key role as a core developer at [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/), contributing significantly to the [CarBravo](https://www.carbravo.com/) domain and spearheading projects within the [OnStar Services'](https://www.onstar.com/) streaming infrastructure. 

Presently engaged in the [BrightDrop](https://www.gobrightdrop.com) project, I am building real-time package tracking services and infrastructure. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or brainstorm ideas for future tech endeavors. 😊
