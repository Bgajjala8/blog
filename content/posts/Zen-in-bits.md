In the age of constant notifications and never-ending scrolling feeds, I catch myself yearning for some tranquility and peace. But let's be real, unplugging is no walk in the park. Our lives are all tangled up in this web, whether we realize it or not. Work, communicationâ€”everything seems to demand a phone and some app.

Now, what's my deal? As someone with ADHD, I know the constant struggle of being drawn to different topics, losing hours to them. My current habits are like so:

1. **Keep scrolling on TikTok**
2. **Comparing/spending endless time on apps like LinkedIn and Instagram**
3. **Not focusing on other goals because of the distraction**
4. **Not able to spend time in my own mind, struggling to understand my thoughts**

Sure, I get the perks of these technologies. Being a software engineer, I geek out seeing how these tools transform our lives. But, here's my plan: stepping back, ditching social media like TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I'm redirecting my time towards delving into music and reading books instead of watching TV, and learning new things rather than spending time scrolling. This isn't the first time I've tried to unplug, but it is the first time I feel confident and the first time I'm doing it with specific goals in mind.

I'm hoping this shift in perspective will uncover what's missing and what I can achieve, all while understanding what I might lose by staying connected.

By the end of this period (starting today and rolling into next year), I aim to figure out what truly adds value to my connected life, and where I might need to disconnect for some benefits. Why now? Two reasons:

1. **Testing if I can spend more quality time with my family (less on my phone)**
2. **Holidays. It's that time when everyone's sharing stories, and I usually find myself glued to all types of media (plus Amazon). By taking a step back, can I gain a new perspective and use this time for things I actually want to do?**

So, here I go!
